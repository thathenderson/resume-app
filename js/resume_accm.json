				"Introduced responsive and adpative design to CI, which became a major selling point for the sales force. For the Where-to-Buy product line, switched from an image and 90s-esque table-based layout to hand-crafted, adaptive, css-based layouts for all 6 individual Where-to-Buy services. Core css was consolidated, and unnecessary markup and external HTTP requests were removed, ultimately improving render time for all services by 66%.",

				"Helped lead and coordinate a project to onboard a vendor team overseas, including designing training resources, documentation, and workflow designs.",
